<h1>GEPD Data Production Template</h1>
<p>An easy to use work flow for going from raw Global Education Policy Dashboard (GEPD) data to a set of key microdata files and indicators.</p>

<p>The template is organized into four main folders:</p>
<pre><code>- `01_GEPD_raw_data` contains the raw data files downloaded from your GEPD Survey Solutions Server.  This folder contains three subfolders: a `School` folder for school data, a `Public_Officials` folder for data from the Survey of Public Officials, and an `Expert_Survey` folder for data from the Expert Policy Survey.
- `02_programs` contains the scripts that will be used to clean and process the raw data. There are separate sub-folders for each of the three data sources: `School`, `Public_Officials`, and `Expert_Survey`.
- `03_GEPD_anonymized_data` contains the cleaned and anonymized data files. There are separate sub-folders for each of the three data sources: `School`, `Public_Officials`, and `Expert_Survey`.
- `04_GEPD_Indicators` contains the set of final GEPD indicators</code></pre>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Download the raw data files from your GEPD Survey Solutions Server and place them in the <code>01_GEPD_raw_data</code> folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the <code>02_programs</code> folder and run the <code>01_GEPD_data_cleaning.do</code> script. This will clean the raw data files and save the cleaned data files in the <code>03_GEPD_anonymized_data</code> folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the <code>02_programs</code> folder and run the <code>02_GEPD_data_processing.do</code> script. This will process the cleaned data files and save the final GEPD indicators in the <code>04_GEPD_Indicators</code> folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the <code>04_GEPD_Indicators</code> folder and check that the final GEPD indicators are correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the <code>02_programs</code> folder and run the <code>03_GEPD_quality_control.do</code> script. This will check the quality of the final GEPD indicators and save the results in the <code>04_GEPD_Indicators</code> folder.</p></li>
